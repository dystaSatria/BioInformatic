# Protein Secondary Structure Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the secondary structure of proteins using machine learning algorithms in Python. The prediction is based on the amino acid sequences of proteins. We leverage the power of Google Colab for efficient computation and easy accessibility.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to preprocess raw protein sequence data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various machine learning models for structure prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Code to evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing the predictions and performance metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Google account for accessing Google Colab.
- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning.

### Installation

1. Download this codes
2. Open it in Google Colab.
3. Install the required Python libraries by running:

```py
!pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Usage

1. Open the project notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells in sequence to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.
3. Modify the hyperparameters or model as needed for experimentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [Protein Secondary Structure dataset](https://example-dataset-link.com). It consists of protein sequences and their corresponding secondary structures.

## Models

We use several machine learning and bioimodels, including:

- Naive Bayes
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)


## Mapping techniques

- EIIP (Electron-Ion Interaction Potential) method
- CPNR (Complex Prime Numerical Representation ) method
