# Protein Secondary Structure Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the secondary structure of proteins using machine learning algorithms in Python. The prediction is based on the amino acid sequences of proteins. We leverage the power of Google Colab for efficient computation and easy accessibility.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to preprocess raw protein sequence data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various machine learning models for structure prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Code to evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing the predictions and performance metrics.
