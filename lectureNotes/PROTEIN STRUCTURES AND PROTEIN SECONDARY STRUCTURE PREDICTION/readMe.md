# Protein Structures and Protein Secondary Structure Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of protein structures and the development of a model for predicting protein secondary structures. The aim is to utilize computational methods and machine learning techniques to understand protein folding and predict their secondary structure based on primary amino acid sequences.

## Features
- Analysis of protein primary structures.
- Implementation of machine learning models for secondary structure prediction.
- Visualization of protein structures.
- Evaluation of model accuracy and performance.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras (or any other ML library)
- Basic understanding of bioinformatics


## Usage
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

1. Load the dataset: `python load_dataset.py`
2. Train the model: `python train_model.py`
3. Evaluate the model: `python evaluate_model.py`
4. Visualize the results: `python visualize_results.py`
