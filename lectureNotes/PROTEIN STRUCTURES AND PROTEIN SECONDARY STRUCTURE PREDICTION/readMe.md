# Protein Structures and Protein Secondary Structure Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of protein structures and the development of a model for predicting protein secondary structures. The aim is to utilize computational methods and machine learning techniques to understand protein folding and predict their secondary structure based on primary amino acid sequences.

## Features
- Analysis of protein primary structures.
- Implementation of machine learning models for secondary structure prediction.
- Visualization of protein structures.
- Evaluation of model accuracy and performance.
